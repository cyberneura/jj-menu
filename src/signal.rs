//! Putting the terminal back when the process is killed.
//!
//! [`crate::ui::TerminalGuard`] covers every exit Rust controls — a return, an
//! error, a panic — because `Drop` runs on all of them. A default-terminating
//! signal is the one that it cannot cover: the process dies inside the kernel,
//! nothing unwinds, and the shell is left in raw mode with the cursor hidden
//! and the alternate screen still on. `kill`, a logout, and a window manager
//! closing the terminal all take that path.
//!
//! So the terminal settings are captured before raw mode is entered and put
//! back from a signal handler. Only async-signal-safe calls are used there:
//! `tcsetattr`, `write` and `raise` are on the POSIX list, whereas crossterm's
//! own teardown takes a lock and could deadlock against the code the signal
//! interrupted.
//!
//! The handler restores the default disposition and re-raises, so the process
//! still dies of the signal it was sent — the exit status a caller sees is the
//! one it would have seen anyway.
