//! Running a `parallel:` group.
//!
//! Every member gets its own `$SHELL -c`, all of them are started before any of
//! them is waited for, and the group is finished when the last one has exited —
//! the same shape as `a & b & wait` in a script.
//!
//! **Each job is put in a process group of its own** (`process_group(0)`), and
//! that is what makes stopping the group work at all:
//!
//! * A signal is sent to the *group* (`kill(-pgid)`), so it reaches the command
//!   the job's shell started, not only the shell. `sh -c "sleep 300"` execs the
//!   sleep, but `sh -c "sleep 300; echo done"` does not — it waits, and a
//!   non-interactive shell does not pass a signal on to what it is waiting for.
//!   Signalling the shell alone would leave that `sleep` running.
//! * The jobs are out of the terminal's foreground group, so a Ctrl-C is
//!   delivered to `jj-menu` and to nobody else. It is then passed on exactly
//!   once — a job cannot see the same interrupt twice and mistake it for the
//!   user asking twice.
//!
//! The cost is that the jobs are background groups: they may write to the
//! terminal, but reading from it would stop them with `SIGTTIN`. They are given
//! `/dev/null` on stdin anyway, since several processes taking turns at the
//! keyboard cannot be told apart by whoever is typing. An entry that needs
//! input belongs in a plain `shell:`.
//!
//! A second stop signal escalates to `SIGKILL`, so a job that ignores the first
//! one cannot hold the menu open, and the group is only left once every child
//! has been reaped — `jj` cannot return to the prompt with jobs still writing
//! to the terminal behind it.
//!
//! What is *not* followed is a process a job put in the background itself
//! (`something &`, `nohup`) and then walked away from. Once the job's own shell
//! has been reaped there is nothing left to wait on: the group is watched
//! through the child, and waiting on the process group ID instead would both
//! hang on any entry that deliberately starts a daemon and start signalling
//! into a group ID the kernel is free to hand to somebody else. A detached
//! process outliving the thing that started it is what detaching means, and a
//! plain `shell:` entry leaves one behind in exactly the same way.
